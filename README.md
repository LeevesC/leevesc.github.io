As a developer, I always want to built my own personal portfolio. But I'm bad at UI and layout design. Luckily I found this open source Personal Portfolio. Thanks Sadee's marvelous work [https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio]

V_1.0.0

- Rewrite this project with React and sass.
- Deploy this in github pages.

## Problems needs to be solved in the future

1. variables definition in variables.scss files, is it not support to override the value of a variable in responsive scss files. e.g. fs-1 in variables.scss is 24px, but when breakpoint large than 580px fs-1 supposed to be 32px. so I don't need to change all css settings which have used fs-1.
